On the other hand, **Cluster 1** shows higher color intensity and malic acid content. **Cluster 0** generally has lower values for most components compared to the other clusters. These findings suggest that wines within **Cluster 2** may possess different characteristics or qualities compared to those in **Clusters 0 and 1**, which could be valuable for winemakers in product segmentation or quality control efforts."
